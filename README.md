Nowadays, Deep Learning is one of the most popular techniques which are used in several fields like handwriting text recognition. Following is for a handwritten digit sequences recognition system. This system, based in two stage model, is composed by Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. Moreover, it is trained using on-demand scheme to recognize numbers from digits of the provided dataset.

Application areas of Automatic Number Plate Recognition

Automatic Number Plate Recognition has a wide range of applications since the license number is the primary, most widely accepted, human readable, mandatory identifier of motor vehicles.

ANPR provides automated access of the content of the number plate for computer systems managing databases and processing information of vehicle movements.

Below we indicated some of the major applications, without the demand of completeness.

Parking

One of the main applications of ANPR is parking automation and parking security: ticketless parking fee management, parking access automation, vehicle location guidance, car theft prevention, "lost ticket" fraud, fraud by changing tickets, simplified, partially or fully automated payment process, among many others.

Access Control

Access control in general is a mechanism for limiting access to areas and resources based on users' identities and their membership in various predefined groups. Access to limited zones, however, may also be managed based on the accessing vehicles alone , or together with personal identity. License plate recognition brings automation of vehicle access control management, providing increased security, car pool management for logistics, security guide assistance, event logging, event management, keeping access diary, possibilities for analysis and data mining.

Motorway Road Tolling

Road Tolling means, that motorists pay directly for the usage of particular segment of road infrastructures. Tolls are a common way of funding the improvements of highways, motorways, roads and bridges: tolls are fees for services. Efficient road tolling increases the level of related road services by reducing travel time overhead, congestion and improve roadways quality. Also, efficient road tolling reduces fraud related to non-payment, makes charging effective, reduces required manpower to process events of exceptions. License plate recognition is mostly used as a very efficient enforcement tool, while there are road tolling systems based solely on license plate recognition too.

Border Control

Border Control is an established state-coordinated effort to achieve operational control of the country's state border with the priority mission of supporting the homeland's security against terrorism, illegal cross border traffic, smuggling and criminal activities. Efficient border control significantly decreases the rate of violent crime and increases the society's security. Automatic number plate recognition adds significant value by event logging, establishing investigate-able databases of border crossings, alarming on suspicious passings, at many more.

Journey Time Measurement

Journey Time Measurement is a very efficient and widely usable method of understanding traffic, detecting conspicuous situations and events, etc. A computer vision based system has its well known downfalls in Journey Time Measurement, while Automatic Number Plate Recognition has provided its viability: vehicle journey times can be measured reliably by automatic number plate recognition-based systems. Data collected by license plate recognition systems can be used in many ways after processing: feeding back information to road users to increase traffic security, helping efficient law enforcement, optimising traffic routes, reducing costs and time, etc.

Law Enforcement

Automatic number plate recognition is an ideal technology to be used for law enforcement purposes. It is able to automatically identify stolen cars based on the up-to date blacklist. Other very common law enforcement applications are red-light enforcement and overspeed charging and bus lane control.
